    "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that cellular bioenergetics is critical in determining the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells. Human platelet lysate (hPL) contains abundant proteins, which has been shown to improve self-renewal and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the detailed modulating effect of hPL on MSCs energy metabolism remains unexplored. This study showed that MSCs cultured in hPL displayed a reduced cell size and cell spreading, but an improved proliferation and osteogenic capability compared with cells maintained in fetal bovine serum (FBS). RNA sequencing revealed widespread transcriptome differences between hPL- and FBS-MSCs where the differential expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched mainly in the PI3K-Akt and metabolic signal pathways. We found a significant downregulation of HIF1A (hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha) and altered mitochondrial features in hPL-MSCs, indicating a metabolism switch of the hPL-treated cells from glycolysis towards mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). It was also demonstrated that hPL-MSCs tend to differentiate towards the aerobic metabolism-demanded osteocytes or adipocytes rather than the anaerobic metabolism-demanded chondrocytes using a differentiation medium. Finally, hPL-MSCs showed an impaired paracrine function where the secreted factors cannot stimulate M2 polarization of THP1 cells and angiogenesis of HUVECs. We concluded that the PI3K-Akt/HIF1A-mediated metabolic state dominated the physiological property and lineage commitment of MSCs in hPL. For the first time, this study demonstrates the molecular mechanism of hPL in the regulation of metabolism and functions of MSCs, which implies the potential of hPL as an efficient biological material for stem cell engineering and regenerative medicine."

    "description": "Human fetal bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (fBMSCs), human adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (aBMSCs), human adipose-MSCs (ASC), THP-1 cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured under specific conditions. fBMSCs, aBMSCs, and ASCs were maintained in complete growth media as recommended by the manufacturer or specific formulations. THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. HUVECs were cultured in vascular cell basal medium supplemented with an endothelial cell growth kit. All cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C under a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For experiments investigating media formulation effects, MSCs were cultured in MEM\u03b1 media supplemented with either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or various concentrations of human platelet lysate (hPL). Cell proliferation and activity were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Quant-iT\u2122 PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit. Osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation were induced using specific induction media containing relevant reagents. Immunofluorescence staining for vinculin, F-actin, and type I collagen was performed. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured using an ALP assay kit and BCIP/NBT Alkaline Phosphatase Color Development Kit. Alizarin Red S staining was used to assess mineralization. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) deposition was evaluated using Alcian blue staining and quantified via a dimethyl methylene blue (DMB) dye assay. RNA sequencing was performed on cells cultured under different conditions (hPL vs. FBS, with or without osteogenic induction). HIF1A expression was examined at both transcriptional and protein levels. Mitochondrial morphology was assessed using Mito-Tracker Green, and mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated using a JC-1 assay kit and flow cytometry. Immunomodulatory capacity was assessed by evaluating cytokine production (TNF\u03b1, IL-10) from macrophages treated with conditioned media (CM) from hPL- or FBS-treated MSCs. Angiogenic capacity was evaluated through HUVEC tube formation assay and proliferation assay. Real-time RT-PCR was used for gene expression analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc multiple comparisons."

RNA sequencing revealed differential gene expression enriched in PI3K-Akt and metabolic pathways, with a downregulation of HIF1A and altered mitochondrial features, suggesting a shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). hPL-treated MSCs showed a preference for osteocyte or adipocyte differentiation over chondrocyte differentiation. Furthermore, hPL-MSCs exhibited impaired paracrine functions, with reduced ability to stimulate M2 polarization of THP1 cells and angiogenesis of HUVECs. The study concludes that the PI3K-Akt/HIF1A-mediated metabolic state regulated by hPL influences MSC properties and lineage commitment, highlighting hPL's potential in stem cell engineering and regenerative medicine. Specifically, hPL promotes osteogenic differentiation and adipogenesis while suppressing chondrogenesis and impacting immunomodulatory and angiogenic capacities."
