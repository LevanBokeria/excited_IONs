    "abstract": "Excessive reactive oxygen species is the major component of a harsh microenvironment after ischemia/reperfusion injury in human tissues. Combined treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) promoted the growth of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and suppressed oxidative stress-induced cell death by enhancing mitochondrial integrity and function in vitro. In this study, we aimed to determine whether NAC and AAP (termed MCA) could enhance the therapeutic potential of hMSCs. We established a coculture system consisting of MCA-treated and H2O2-treated hMSCs and investigated the role of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in the exchange of mitochondria between the 2 cell populations. The consequences of mitochondria exchange were assessed by fluorescence confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The results showed that MCA could increase the mitochondrial mass, respiratory capacity, and numbers of TNTs in hMSCs. The 'energized' mitochondria were transferred to the injured hMSCs via TNTs, the oxidative stress was decreased, and the mitochondrial membrane potential of the H2O2-treated hMSCs was stabilized. The transfer of mitochondria decreased the expression of S616-phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1, a protein that dictates the fragmentation/fission of mitochondria. Concurrently, MCA also enhanced mitophagy in the coculture system, implicating that damaged mitochondria were eliminated in order to maintain cell physiology."

    "description": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were utilized, sourced from adipose tissue with donor consent. Isolation followed a previously established method. Cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL FGF-2, and 2 mM L-glutamine, adjusted to contain 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate. Experiments used hMSCs between passages 3 and 6. For treatments, the mesenchymal stem cell adjuvant (MCA) consisted of 2 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and 0.2 mM L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP). Control cells were cultured in standard medium without MCA. H2O2 treatments used Sigma's H2O2. Oxygen consumption was measured using Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros Instruments Corp.) at 37\u00b0C, with cells harvested, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS. Maximal oxidative capacities (state 3) were determined in the presence of room air oxygen. Respiration rates were calculated using DatLab software and expressed per million viable cells. Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity was assessed using the WST-8 assay (CCK-8 Cell Counting Kit-8, Enzo Sci. Inc.) with 1-methoxy-PMS as an electron carrier. Cells were incubated with 10 \u03bcL of CCK-8 reagent at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours, and absorbance was read at 450nm. For detecting mitochondria transfer, hMSCs were stained with MitoTracker Red (for healthy cells) or MitoTracker Green (for H2O2-treated cells) (Molecular Probes). Injured cells (0.5 mM H2O2 for 4h) were cocultured (1:1 ratio) with control or MCA-treated healthy cells and observed via confocal microscopy (LSM510 Meta, Carl Zeiss). For quantification of mitochondria transfer, healthy cells were labeled with 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and MCA-treated hMSCs with MitoTracker Red. After 24h coculture, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, US), quantifying MitoTracker Red fluorescence in CFDA-free cells. Mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) was assessed using JC-1 (5 \u03bcM), mitochondrial ROS with MitoSOX Red (5 \u03bcM), and mitochondrial mass with MitoTracker Green (0.1 \u03bcM) (all from Molecular Probes). Cells were stained at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Western blotting was performed on harvested cells after various treatments, with protein expressions quantified densitometrically after SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For TNT quantification, actin was stained with phalloidin 633 (4 units/mL, Molecular Probes) on live cells with 0.05% Triton X, followed by fixation. TNTs were counted per 100 cells. Antibodies used included anti-Drp-1, anti-phospho-Drp-1 Ser616 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Mfn2 (GeneTex), and anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma). Inhibitors included 50 \u03bcM nocodazole (Sigma) to inhibit gap junctions and microtubule polymerization. Statistical analysis involved quantifying band intensities or fluorescence using AlphaDigiDoc, ImageJ, or MicroP software. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM, analyzed by Student's t-test."
