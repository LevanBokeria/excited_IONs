    "abstract": "Excessive reactive oxygen species is the major component of a harsh microenvironment after ischemia/reperfusion injury in human tissues. Combined treatment of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) promoted the growth of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and suppressed oxidative stress-induced cell death by enhancing mitochondrial integrity and function in vitro. In this study, we aimed to determine whether NAC and AAP (termed MCA) could enhance the therapeutic potential of hMSCs. We established a coculture system consisting of MCA-treated and H2O2-treated hMSCs and investigated the role of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) in the exchange of mitochondria between the 2 cell populations. The consequences of mitochondria exchange were assessed by fluorescence confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. The results showed that MCA could increase the mitochondrial mass, respiratory capacity, and numbers of TNTs in hMSCs. The 'energized' mitochondria were transferred to the injured hMSCs via TNTs, the oxidative stress was decreased, and the mitochondrial membrane potential of the H2O2-treated hMSCs was stabilized. The transfer of mitochondria decreased the expression of S616-phosphorylated dynamin-related protein 1, a protein that dictates the fragmentation/fission of mitochondria. Concurrently, MCA also enhanced mitophagy in the coculture system, implicating that damaged mitochondria were eliminated in order to maintain cell physiology."

Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (a) and mitochondrial mass (b) of hMSCs treated with or without MCA for 24 h was assessed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometric analysis of MitoTracker Red-labeled mitochondria, respectively. (c) The cell density of hMSCs with or without MCA treatment for 24 h was assessed by counting the harvested cells and normalized to the area of the culture flask. (d) The mitochondria of the hMSCs with or without MCA treatment were labeled with MitoTracker Red and subjected to confocal microscopy. The mitochondria were classified using MicroP software according to their morphology: small globules, linear tubules, loops, branched tubules, and twisted tubules. Three major types of mitochondria were quantified: globular, tubular, and branched ((e), upper panel), as well as their total length ((e), lower panel). (f) Mitochondrial bioenergetics of the indicated cells was determined by oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using Oroboros Oxygraph-2k analyzer. The MCA consisted of 2 mM NAC and 0.2 mM AAP. The concentrations of NAC and AAP were 2 mM and 0.2 mM, respectively, in monotreatments. OCR measured at basal respiration (upper left), maximal respiration (upper right), ATP-coupled respiration (lower left), and spare capacity (lower right) were shown. * p < 0 05 , ** p < 0 01 , *** p < 0 001 , as compared to the control (Ctrl); n.s., not significant."

(a) Representative images of mitochondria transfer to H2O2 treated hMSCs from hMSCs with (right panel) or without (left panel) MCA treatment. The MitoTracker Red-labeled mitochondria from the healthy hMSCs were also clearly seen in TNT formed between the recipient and donor (inset i). Both MitoTracker Red- and Green-labeled mitochondria were found in the recipient cells (inset ii). The Pearson correlation coefficient are also shown to demonstrate the colocalization of the MitoTracker Red and Green labelled mitochondria after coculture [30]. The results showed that the colocalization coefficient in the (ii) of upper panel (24 h coculture of control hMSCs and H2O2-treated hMSCs) is 0.594, while that in the (ii) of lower panel (24 h coculture of MCA-treated hMSCs and H2O2-treated hMSCs) is 0.908. The colocalization coefficient can be further represented as pseudocolor changes: orange dots represent highly overlapping, while purple dots represent no overlapping. A 2.5-dimensional fluorescence reconstruction analysis of the respective images in (a) further confirmed that the red fluorescence was predominantly found in the TNT form between MCA-treated hMSCs and H2O2-treated hMSCs (b).

    "description": "Human adipose-derived MSCs were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL FGF-2, and 2 mM L-glutamine. Experiments were conducted using MSCs between passages 3 and 6. For MCA treatment, cells were incubated with 2 mM NAC and 0.2 mM AAP for 24 hours. Oxidative stress was induced by treating cells with 0.5 mM H2O2 for 4 hours. Coculture experiments involved mixing healthy and H2O2-treated hMSCs at a 1:1 ratio. Mitochondria were labeled with MitoTracker Red (healthy cells) or MitoTracker Green (injured cells). Cell viability and mitochondrial function were assessed using various assays, including oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, JC-1 staining for mitochondrial membrane potential, MitoSOX Red for mitochondrial ROS, and flow cytometry for quantification of mitochondria transfer and ROS levels. Tunneling nanotube formation was quantified by phalloidin staining of actin. Protein expression, specifically phospho-Drp-1 Ser616, was analyzed by Western blotting."

    "summary": "Treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP), termed MCA, enhanced human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) growth and survival by improving mitochondrial function and integrity. In a coculture system of MCA-treated and H2O2-treated hMSCs, MCA increased mitochondrial mass, respiratory capacity, and the formation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs). Healthy hMSCs transferred 'energized' mitochondria to injured hMSCs via TNTs, reducing oxidative stress and stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential. This transfer also decreased the phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1 S616), a protein involved in mitochondrial fragmentation. Furthermore, MCA treatment enhanced mitophagy, promoting the elimination of damaged mitochondria. Overall, MCA pretreatment improved the therapeutic potential of hMSCs by enhancing mitochondrial transfer and quality control, offering a novel strategy for stem cell-based therapy."
