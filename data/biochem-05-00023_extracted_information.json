    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with ischemic heart disease alone accounting for 9 million deaths annually [1]. The burden is especially significant in Indonesia [2], Japan [3], and the United States [4], where aging populations and lifestyle-related risk factors contribute to an escalating incidence of heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and congenital heart disorders. Despite advances in pharmacological and interventional therapies, cardiomyocyte (CM) loss in cardiac diseases remains irreversible, necessitating regenerative approaches [8]. Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) have emerged as a promising cell source for cardiac repair and disease modeling [9,10]. However, a fundamental challenge remains: iPSC-CMs exhibit metabolic immaturity, underdeveloped mitochondrial architecture, and suboptimal oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, limiting their ability to mimic the contractile and electrophysiological properties of adult CMs [11-14]. Mitochondrial maturation is crucial for iPSC-CMs to mimic the contractile and electrophysiological properties of adult cardiomyocytes. Without proper mitochondrial maturation, these cells cannot efficiently integrate into host cardiac tissue, limiting their therapeutic potential in clinical applications such as myocardial infarction repair or tissue engineering. In native human cardiac development, the metabolic landscape undergoes a tightly regulated shift from a glycolytic fetal profile to an oxidative, fatty acid-dependent phenotype in postnatal life [15]. Fetal CMs primarily rely on anaerobic glycolysis and lactate oxidation to support rapid proliferation, with relatively low mitochondrial density and cristae complexity [16,17]. Postnatally, increased oxygen availability and hormonal changes trigger a surge in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity, enabling fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to become the dominant ATP-generating pathway [15,18]. This transition defines the metabolic benchmark for maturation and underpins the energetic demands of adult CMs. Replicating this transition in vitro is central to engineering functional iPSC-CMs that can recapitulate adult-like cardiac physiology. To better understand the extent of mitochondrial maturation in iPSC-CMs, we summarize key features in Table 1, comparing fetal cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs at different maturation stages, and adult cardiomyocytes. This comparison highlights the current gaps and the need for advanced strategies to enhance mitochondrial function."

These interventions include metabolic preconditioning (substrate optimization, fatty acid supplementation, hypoxia/reoxygenation cycles), genetic and pharmacological modulation (e.g., PGC-1\u03b1 overexpression, AMPK activation, mTOR inhibition), biophysical and electrical stimulation strategies (mechanical stress, extracellular matrix composition, electrical pacing), and computational/systems biology approaches (multi-omics profiling, predictive modeling). Studies utilize various assays to assess mitochondrial structure and function, such as Seahorse extracellular flux analysis, electron microscopy, ROS quantification, ATP production assays, and in vivo transplantation models. Computational models, including machine learning and metabolic flux balance analysis, are employed to predict and optimize metabolic interventions. Clinical translation considerations involve analyzing preprints, clinical trial databases, and regulatory reports."
  },
  "experimental_results": {
    "summary": "Evidence indicates that metabolic preconditioning with fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation enhancers improves mitochondrial architecture, cristae density, and ATP production. Substrate manipulation fosters a shift toward adult-like metabolism, while pathway modulation refines mitochondrial biogenesis. Computational models enhance precision, predicting interventions that best align iPSC-CM metabolism with native cardiomyocytes. The synergy between metabolic and biomechanical cues offers new avenues for accelerating maturation, bridging the gap between in vitro models and functional cardiac tissues."
