        "content": "Neurons require an increased supply of ATP compared to other cells in order to establish membrane potential for neurotransmission and synaptic activity. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria is the primary source for cellular ATP, thus mitochondrial dysfunction often associates with neurodegenerative diseases. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the optic nerve require a steady source of ATP for their firing and long axons make them particularly vulnerable. Differentiated hRGCs used here are well characterized and show hallmark features of human RGCs, including neuronal markers, RGC-specific markers, and electrophysiological properties. To investigate MQC in human RGCs, we used a glaucoma-associated OPTN E50K mutation in human stem cells to model disease in a dish. We asked if hRGCs can maintain mitochondrial homeostasis under acute damage and found that under CCCP-induced acute mitochondrial damage, hRGCs activate the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway to sustain mitochondrial homeostasis."

        "content": "To directly measure degradation and biogenesis, we used mitochondria-specific dyes and flow cytometry. MTDR retention reflects active membrane potential and amino-reactive covalent binding to mitochondria; the loss of MTDR signal after CCCP indicates degradation of labeled mitochondria, while recovery after CCCP wash indicates biogenesis of newly synthesized mitochondria. We used MTDR labeling followed by a CCCP treatment and measured labeled mitochondrial mass at multiple time points to track degradation. For biogenesis, we pre-label mitochondria with MTDR, apply CCCP to induce damage, wash, and then re-label with MTDR to detect newly synthesized mitochondria, allowing separation of degraded versus newly formed mitochondria in single cells."

        "content": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the master energy sensor that activates mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC1\u03b1. TBK1 normally inhibits AMPK activity by phosphorylation to reduce energy expenditure; TBK1 inhibition has been shown to increase energy expenditure and promote biogenesis. We hypothesized that CCCP-induced damage would activate AMPK\u2013PGC1\u03b1 axis in hRGCs to drive biogenesis. The AMPK\u2013PGC1\u03b1 axis leads to transcriptional activation of NRF transcription factors and mitochondrial biogenesis genes such as NRF1, NRF2, PRC, and TFAM, enabling replication and maintenance of mtDNA."

TBK1 inhibition also increased mtDNA copy number, and induced AMPK\u2013PGC1\u03b1 signaling in WT cells; however, in E50K cells, activation of AMPK\u2013PGC1\u03b1 was less clear for some timepoints, suggesting alternative or additional TBK1-dependent biogenesis pathways may operate in glaucomatous hRGCs. PGC1\u03b2 was upregulated in response to BX795, especially in E50K cells, suggesting a PGC1\u03b1-independent biogenesis route as well."

Under basal and CCCP conditions, BX795 improved spare respiratory capacity, enabling higher ATP production during stress.

Activation of the AMPK\u2013PGC1\u03b1 axis under mitochondrial damage drives biogenesis, while TBK1 inhibition via BX795 augments mitochondrial biogenesis and improves energy homeostasis, reducing swelling and apoptosis in E50K hRGCs. These findings point to TBK1 as a potential therapeutic target for optic neuropathies characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction, with potential applicability to other CNS disorders where mitochondrial homeostasis is compromised. The data suggest a dual mechanism: (i) restoration of energy balance via increased biogenesis and (ii) dissolution of OPTN aggregates that contribute to neuroprotection. Further work is needed to delineate TBK1\u2013PGC1\u03b2\u2013NRF pathways and their contributions to biogenesis in glaucomatous cells."

TBK1 inhibitor BX795 (1 \u03bcg/ml) and vehicle controls (DMSO) were used to modulate biogenesis pathways. CCCP (10 \u03bcM) was used to induce acute mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial turnover was assessed using MTDR and JC1 dyes in flow cytometry and live imaging, respectively. Mitochondrial biogenesis signaling was monitored by qPCR for PGC1\u03b1, PGC1\u03b2, NRF1, NRF2, PRC, and TFAM; protein activation states were assessed by Western blot for p-AMPK\u03b1Thr172 and p-PGC1\u03b1Ser571.

      "summary": "Key findings: hRGCs rapidly degrade damaged mitochondria via mitophagy and simultaneously initiate biogenesis to maintain mitochondrial mass under acute CCCP damage. AMPK\u03b1\u2013PGC1\u03b1 signaling is activated by mitochondrial damage to drive biogenesis; E50K hRGCs show reduced basal mitochondrial mass and heightened swelling under stress. TBK1 inhibition with BX795 increases mitochondrial biogenesis and mass in both WT and E50K hRGCs, with PGC1\u03b2 upregulation particularly in E50K cells. BX795 also reduces mitochondrial swelling, decreases basal and damage-induced Caspase activity, and increases spare respiratory capacity, indicating improved energy homeostasis. In WT cells, BX795 robustly activates AMPK\u2013PGC1\u03b1 signaling; in E50K cells, biogenesis appears partially AMPK\u2013PGC1\u03b1-independent but still results in increased mitochondrial mass. OPTN E50K aggregates are reduced upon BX795 treatment, contributing to neuroprotection. These results demonstrate that pharmacological TBK1 inhibition can promote MQC and protect hRGCs from acute mitochondrial damage, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for glaucoma-linked optic neuropathies."
