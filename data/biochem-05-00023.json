    "abstract": "Background: Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) hold transformative potential for cardiovascular regenerative medicine, yet their clinical application is hindered by suboptimal mitochondrial maturation and metabolic inefficiencies. This systematic review evaluates targeted strategies for optimizing mitochondrial function, integrating metabolic preconditioning, substrate selection, and pathway modulation to enhance energy production and cellular resilience. Additionally, we examine the role of extracellular matrix stiffness and mechanical stimulation in mitochondrial adaptation, given their influence on metabolism and maturation. Methods: A comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in iPSC-CM maturation was conducted, focusing on metabolic interventions that enhance mitochondrial structure and function. Studies employing metabolic preconditioning, lipid and amino acid supplementation, and modulation of key signaling pathways, including PGC-1\u03b1, AMPK, and mTOR, were reviewed. Computational modeling approaches predicting optimal metabolic shifts were assessed, alongside insights into reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, calcium handling, and the impact of electrical pacing on energy metabolism. Results: Evidence indicates that metabolic preconditioning with fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation enhancers improves mitochondrial architecture, cristae density, and ATP production. Substrate manipulation fosters a shift toward adult-like metabolism, while pathway modulation refines mitochondrial biogenesis. Academic Editors: Buyong Ma and Manuel Aureliano. Computational models enhance precision, predicting interventions that best align iPSC-CM metabolism with native cardiomyocytes. The synergy between metabolic and biomechanical cues offers new avenues for accelerating maturation, bridging the gap between in vitro models and functional cardiac tissues. Conclusions: Strategic metabolic optimization is essential for overcoming mitochondrial immaturity in iPSC-CMs. By integrating biochemical engineering, predictive modeling, and biomechanical conditioning, a robust framework emerges for advancing iPSC-CM applications in regenerative therapy and disease modeling. These findings pave the way for more physiologically relevant cell models, addressing key translational challenges in cardiovascular medicine.",

        "title": "1. Introduction",
        "content": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with ischemic heart disease alone accounting for 9 million deaths annually. The burden is especially significant in Indonesia, Japan, and the United States, where aging populations and lifestyle-related risk factors contribute to escalating heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and congenital heart disorders. iPSC-CMs offer a promising solution, but their metabolic immaturity presents significant challenges that must be overcome for clinical success. In native human cardiac development, the metabolic landscape shifts from a glycolytic fetal profile to an oxidative, fatty acid-dependent phenotype postnatally. Recreating this transition in vitro is central to engineering functional iPSC-CMs that mimic adult-like cardiac physiology. Table 1 summarizes key features of mitochondrial maturation across developmental stages (fetal CMs, iPSC-CMs at various maturation points, and adult CMs). This matrix translates domain-specific maturation data into a unified evaluative index, providing a quantitative lens to assess maturation relative to adult cardiomyocytes. Mitochondria play a pivotal role in CM function, ATP generation, calcium homeostasis, and ROS regulation; dysfunction can contribute to HF, arrhythmias, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Thus, bridging the metabolic gap is crucial for translational iPSC-CM applications in regenerative medicine and disease modeling."

Despite these advances, limitations persist: most studies are in vitro with heterogeneous iPSC-CM populations; long-term effects on arrhythmogenic potential and functional stability are underexplored; and there is a paucity of large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Computational modeling to optimize metabolic interventions remains in its infancy, underscoring the need for data-driven approaches to tailor mitochondrial enhancement."

Computational and multi-omics strategies show promise for guiding culture conditions and targeting gene-regulatory networks (e.g., PGC-1\u03b1/NRF1/TFAM) to drive maturation, but in vivo validation in large-animal models remains essential."

Data sources included PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, Embase, IEEE Xplore, Cochrane Library, Europe PMC, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, DOAJ, and Google Scholar. Included studies ranged from January 2006 to January 2025 and focused on metabolic interventions, bioengineering approaches, and computational strategies for iPSC-CM mitochondrial maturation. Inclusion criteria emphasized original research, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses with quantitative mitochondrial structure or function metrics; exclusion criteria filtered out unrelated stem cell types or studies lacking experimental validation. Data extraction prioritized metabolic flux assays, mitochondrial morphology and function, in vivo engraftment, bioinformatics analyses, and computational modeling. Data synthesis integrated qualitative and quantitative findings, with bias assessment via ROBINS-I and RoB 2 where applicable."

      "summary": "From 25 included studies, metabolic preconditioning (notably fatty acid supplementation and FAO activation) improved mitochondrial architecture, cristae density, and ATP production; substrate manipulation shifted iPSC-CM metabolism toward adult-like FAO/OXPHOS balance; pathway modulation (PGC-1\u03b1, AMPK, mTOR) refined mitochondrial biogenesis and respiratory capacity. Biophysical conditioning (electrical pacing, ECM cues, mechanical load) enhanced mitochondrial density and oxidative gene expression. Computational and multi-omics approaches augmented predictive power for maturation trajectories and identified master regulators. Baseline iPSC-CMs exhibit fetal-like metabolism with limited cristae density and mitochondrial content, driving energy inefficiency; thus integrated strategies are required to achieve clinically relevant maturity."
