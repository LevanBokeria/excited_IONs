    "abstract": "Mitochondria are vital organelles whose impairment leads to numerous metabolic disorders. Mitochondrial transplantation serves as a promising clinical therapy. However, its widespread application is hindered by the limited availability of healthy mitochondria, with the dose required reaching up to 10 9 mitochondria per injection/patient. This necessitates sustainable and tractable approaches for producing high-quality human mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrated a highly efficient mitochondriaproducing strategy by manipulating mitobiogenesis and tuning organelle balance in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Utilizing an optimized culture medium (mito-condition) developed from our established formula, we achieved an 854-fold increase in mitochondria production compared to normal MSC culture within 15 days. These mitochondria were not only significantly expanded but also exhibited superior function both before and after isolation, with ATP production levels reaching 5.71 times that of normal mitochondria. Mechanistically, we revealed activation of the AMPK pathway and the establishment of a novel cellular state ideal for mitochondrial fabrication, characterized by enhanced proliferation and mitobiogenesis while suppressing other energy-consuming activities. Furthermore, the in vivo function of these mitochondria was validated in the mitotherapy in a mouse osteoarthritis model, resulting in significant cartilage regeneration over a 12-week period. Overall, this study presented a new strategy for the off-the-shelf fabrication of human mitochondria and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms governing organelle synthesis."

    "description": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were cultured under standard conditions (tc-MSCs) or a specialized \"mito-condition\" medium (mc-MSCs) optimized for mitochondrial production. This mito-condition medium contained a specific combination of nine factors: basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), lipid concentrate, Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS), progesterone (Prog), hydrocortisone (Hc), Vitamin C (Vc), heparin sodium (HS), and human platelet lysate (HPL). The study involved comparing the characteristics of mc-MSCs and tc-MSCs, including cell proliferation, mitochondrial quantity and quality, gene expression, and functional assays. Isolated mitochondria from both culture conditions (tc-Mito and mc-Mito) were also compared. In vivo studies involved using a mouse osteoarthritis (OA) model, where mc-mitochondria and tc-mitochondria were injected into the joints to assess their therapeutic effects on cartilage regeneration. Various analytical techniques were employed, including high-resolution imaging, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Seahorse extracellular flux analysis, ATP assays, JC-1 assay for mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), Western blot analysis, cell scratch migration assay, cell adhesion assay, isolation of extracellular vesicles (EVs), micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), histological analysis (Safranin-O/Fast green staining), immunohistochemistry (IHC) for COL2 and ACAN, and bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Animal experiments were conducted following ethical approval and involved surgical induction of OA followed by intra-articular injections of mitochondria."

    "summary": "A novel strategy for fabricating human mitochondria involves manipulating mitogenesis and organelle balance in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) using an optimized culture medium (mito-condition). This approach resulted in an 854-fold increase in mitochondria production within 15 days, with significantly enhanced mitochondrial function, including a 5.71-fold increase in ATP production compared to normal mitochondria. Mechanistically, the strategy activates the AMPK pathway and creates a cellular state favoring proliferation and mitogenesis while suppressing other energy-consuming activities. In vivo studies demonstrated the efficacy of these mitochondria in promoting cartilage regeneration in a mouse osteoarthritis model over 12 weeks.",
