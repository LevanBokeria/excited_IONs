    "abstract": "Mitochondria are vital organelles whose impairment leads to numerous metabolic disorders. Mitochondrial transplantation serves as a promising clinical therapy. However, its widespread application is hindered by the limited availability of healthy mitochondria, with the dose required reaching up to 10 9 mitochondria per injection/patient. This necessitates sustainable and tractable approaches for producing high-quality human mitochondria. In this study, we demonstrated a highly ef /uniFB01 cient mitochondriaproducing strategy by manipulating mitobiogenesis and tuning organelle balance in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Utilizing an optimized culture medium (mito-condition) developed from our established formula, we achieved an 854-fold increase in mitochondria production compared to normal MSC culture within 15 days. These mitochondria were not only signi /uniFB01 cantly expanded but also exhibited superior function both before and after isolation, with ATP production levels reaching 5.71 times that of normal mitochondria. Mechanistically, we revealed activation of the AMPK pathway and the establishment of a novel cellular state ideal for mitochondrial fabrication, characterized by enhanced proliferation and mitobiogenesis while suppressing other energy-consuming activities. Furthermore, the in vivo function of these mitochondria was validated in the mitotherapy in a mouse osteoarthritis model, resulting in signi /uniFB01 cant cartilage regeneration over a 12-week period. Overall, this study presented a new strategy for the off-the-shelf fabrication of human mitochondria and provided insights into the molecular mechanisms governing organelle synthesis."

Mitochondria were isolated using a cell mitochondria isolation kit. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 assay. Cell proliferation was evaluated by population doubling time (PDT), cell cycle analysis, EdU assay, and colony formation unit (CFU) assay. Mitochondrial content was analyzed by MitoTracker staining, TEM, and quantification of mitochondrial protein and mtDNA. Mitochondrial function was assessed by Seahorse XF96 analyzer for oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP assay, JC-1 assay for mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and ROS assay. Gene expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) related genes was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of OXPHOS-related proteins was assessed by Western blot. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using bulk RNA-seq. For in vivo studies, a mouse osteoarthritis (OA) model was established by medial meniscectomy (MMx). Mitochondria were injected intra-articularly. Histological analysis (Safranin-O/Fast green staining, immunohistochemistry for COL2 and ACAN), OARSI scoring, and micro-CT analysis were performed to evaluate cartilage regeneration and OA progression. DiR-labeled mitochondria were used for in vivo tracking."
